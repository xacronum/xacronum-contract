# Xacronum Security Policy

We operate under quiet vigilance.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a vulnerability, contact us privately.
Do not disclose it publicly.
Silent channels maintain order.

We review every report with priority and discipline.
Disruptive behavior or extortion attempts result in permanent exclusion.

## Philosophy
Security is not noise.
Protection is duty.
Silence is strength.
