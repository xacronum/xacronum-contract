XAC TOKENOMICS

Xacronum (“XAC”) is a digital token compatible with the ERC-20 token standard.
XAC has no functions, no promised utility and no intrinsic value, and carries no promise or expectation of any financial return, profit, interest, or dividend.

There is no roadmap and no promise or expectation that any ecosystem will be developed for XAC.

XAC is not designed to perform any task.
It exists for cultural, symbolic, and entertainment purposes only.

For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of the above, XAC is not, and is not intended to:

- entitle holders to exchange XAC for goods or services;

- be a representation of money (including e-money);

- be a digital representation of a capital markets product, security, share, debenture, unit in a collective investment scheme, derivatives contract, commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument or investment in any jurisdiction;

- be a capital markets product, security, share, debenture, unit in a collective investment scheme, derivatives contract, commodity, or any other kind of financial instrument or investment in any jurisdiction;

- represent any shareholding, participation, right (including but not limited to voting rights), title, stake or interest in, or right to participate in the business operations of any entity, enterprise, or undertaking (including without limitation any entity related to Xacronum);

- represent any entitlement to any voting rights in respect of the “Xacronum” ecosystem or any related platform;

- represent any entitlement to fees, dividends, revenue, profits, or investment returns;

- represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or purported purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;
