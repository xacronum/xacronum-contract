# Xacronum Brand Doctrine

Black & white. No gradients. No shine.
Face hidden. Hooded figure or abstract presence only.
No weapons. No aggression. Pure discipline.

One emblem only — matte, carved, silent authority.
No repeating logos. No clutter. No noise.
Geometry, shadow, and space define power.

Visual tone: stillness, order, inevitability.
Silence is the loudest voice here.
